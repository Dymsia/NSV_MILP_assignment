% Loop through possibilities.  Trap singularity warning and then use
% lastwarn to see if that plane of AA is near singular.  Process any such
% segment pairs to determine if they are colinear (overlap) or merely
% parallel.  That test consists of checking to see if one of the endpoints
% of the curve 2 segment lies on the curve 1 segment.  This is done by
% checking the cross product
%
%   (x1(2),y1(2)) - (x1(1),y1(1)) x (x2(2),y2(2)) - (x1(1),y1(1)).
%
% If this is close to zero then the segments overlap.

% If the robust option is false then we assume no two segment pairs are
% parallel and just go ahead and do the computation.  If A is ever singular
% a warning will appear.  This is faster and obviously you should use it
% only when you know you will never have overlapping or parallel segment
% pairs.
